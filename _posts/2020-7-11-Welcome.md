Hello, welcome to this new website. As you can see we are lacking in content, but that's OK. It will come. What matters is that we have math: 

A randomized algorithm \\(M : \mathcal{X}^n \to \mathcal{Y}\\) is \\((\varepsilon,\delta)\\)-differentially private if, for all \\(x,x' \in \mathcal{X}^n\\) differing on a single entry and all measurable \\(E \subseteq \mathcal{Y}\\), we have \\[\mathbb{P}[M(x) \in E] \le e^\varepsilon \cdot \mathbb{P}[M(x') \in E]  + \delta.\\]
