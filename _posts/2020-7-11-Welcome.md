Hello, welcome to this new website. Our goal is to serve as a hub for the differential privacy research community and to promote the work in this area.

We anticipate posting a variety of content, from announcements to mini-surveys of topics in the differential privacy literature. 

This is a community-driven effort and we welcome participation. 
If you are interested in contributing, please reach out to us (by email or in the comments below ). 

To get things started, here is a definition:

> **Definition 1.** [_\[DMNS06\]_](https://journalprivacyconfidentiality.org/index.php/jpc/article/view/405)
> 
> A randomized algorithm \\(M : \mathcal{X}^n \to \mathcal{Y}\\) is \\((\varepsilon,\delta)\\)-differentially private if, for all \\(x,x' \in \mathcal{X}^n\\) differing on a single entry and all measurable \\(E \subseteq \mathcal{Y}\\), we have \\[\mathbb{P}[M(x) \in E] \le e^\varepsilon \cdot \mathbb{P}[M(x') \in E]  + \delta.\\]
