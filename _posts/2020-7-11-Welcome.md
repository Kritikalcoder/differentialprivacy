Hello, welcome to this new website for the differential privacy research community. We anticipate posting a variety of content, from announcements to mini-surveys of topics in the differential privacy research literature. 

Please suggest posts (in the comments below or by contacting the organizers directly). We do hope that members of the community will contribute to this website.

To get things started, here is a definition:

> A randomized algorithm \\(M : \mathcal{X}^n \to \mathcal{Y}\\) is \\((\varepsilon,\delta)\\)-differentially private if, for all \\(x,x' \in \mathcal{X}^n\\) differing on a single entry and all measurable \\(E \subseteq \mathcal{Y}\\), we have \\[\mathbb{P}[M(x) \in E] \le e^\varepsilon \cdot \mathbb{P}[M(x') \in E]  + \delta.\\]
